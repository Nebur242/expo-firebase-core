# expo-firebase-core

> Source code for the deprecated expo-firebase-core package. See our [Using Firebase](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-firebase/) guide for how to use the Firebase JS SDK or React Native Firebase directly. If you still use this package, see our [Migration Guide](https://expo.fyi/firebase-migration-guide) for help upgrading.

This module provides access to the Firebase configuration and performs initialisation
of the native Firebase App. Unimodules that want to use Firebase can use
this module to get safe access to the native Firebase App.
